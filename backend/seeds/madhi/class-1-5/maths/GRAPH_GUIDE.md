  ⚠️  SEED, NOT THE SOURCE OF TRUTH.

  This file is what a namespace's guide was FIRST CREATED FROM. The guide the
  server actually serves lives in that namespace's config cell in Firestore, and
  experts edit it there through `edit_profile`. The two drift apart the moment
  anyone edits the live one — and they have: this copy still describes shapes the
  live curriculum no longer has.

  To read what is actually in force:   get_graph_guide  (or get_profile)
  To change it:                        edit_profile, then publish_draft

  Editing THIS file changes nothing that is running. It is used only to seed a
  brand-new namespace, and it is not shipped in the production image.

# Madhi Maths (Class 1–5) — graph guide

How the Madhi maths knowledge graph is shaped. This is a **standards-only
reference framework** in the Indian NEP/NCF idiom (an EIDU export). There is no
teaching content to author or generate: no `Lesson`, `Activity`, or `Material`,
and no deliverables. You browse and align against it; you do not author lessons
into it.

## The hierarchy

A single `StandardsFramework` root, then a pure `hasChild` tree of
`StandardsFrameworkItem`s whose **kind is their level** (their `statementType`):

```
Curricular Goal        (a broad aim pupils work towards)
  └─ Competency        (a capability that realizes the goal)
       └─ Content       (the finest learning-outcome/content leaf)
```

`Content` is the finest standards leaf. A `LearningComponent` `supports` a
`Competency` or a `Content` item — the fine-grained skills EIDU attaches beneath
the standards.

## Only two edge types

- `hasChild` — the containment tree above (Curricular Goal → Competency → Content).
- `supports` — a `LearningComponent` to the SFI it elaborates.

There is **no** `hasPart`, no `hasEducationalAlignment`, and no ordinal field —
sequence is traversal order, not a `position`.

## Conventions

- **Kinds are the graph's own words** — an SFI's level is its `statementType`
  (`Curricular Goal`/`Competency`/`Content`); the fine-grained skills are
  `LearningComponent`s by label.
- **No content authoring, no coverage.** This framework exists to be browsed and
  aligned against, not to hold generated materials — nothing to "complete", so no
  coverage expectations.
- **Deleting is bulk and cascades.** `delete_nodes` / `delete_edges` each take an
  ARRAY (one atomic draft edit, all-or-nothing). `delete_nodes` cascades along
  `hasChild`: removing an SFI takes its descendants and their incident
  `supports`/`hasChild` edges. The dry-run WARNS with the full set before you
  confirm (no force flag).
