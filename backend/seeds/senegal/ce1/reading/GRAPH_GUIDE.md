# CE1 Reading — graph guide

How the CE1-reading knowledge graph is shaped, and how to author it. Guidance for
you (the LLM), not machine config: the server already parses the graph; read this
to know the conventions before you walk or edit it.

## The subject in one line

A **bilingual** (Wolof L1 / French L2) reading programme organised by **week**. The
`Semaine` (week) is the teaching unit; the weeks sit under a content **`Course`** root
named **Planification** (the curriculum). The deliverable — the teacher's guide — is a
separate **`TeachingLearningMaterial`** (TLM) that `covers` that Course and carries the
formatters (see *Generating documents*).

## Two layers

- **Content layer (what a teacher delivers).** A `Course` root (**Planification**)
  —`hasPart`→ its `Semaine` (week) groupings —`hasPart`→ their day `Lesson`s (`Jour
  1`…`Jour 5`) —`hasPart`→ that day's session `Activity`s. ~22 weeks, 5 days each, ~22
  sessions a week. This is the canonical LC content nesting: a `LessonGrouping` (the
  week) holds `Lesson`s (the days), each holding `Activity`s (the sessions).
- **Standards spine (what the sessions teach).** A `StandardsFramework` root
  —`hasChild`→ `StandardsFrameworkItem`s. A reading SFI's **kind is its skill area**
  (its `statementType`): `Lecture`, `Écriture / Copie`, `Grammaire`, `Conjugaison`,
  `Orthographe`, `Vocabulaire`, `Production d'écrits`, `Expression orale`,
  `Récitation` (an SFI with no statementType reads as the generic
  `StandardsFrameworkItem`). A `LearningComponent` `supports` the SFI it belongs to.

## How the layers connect

Each session `Activity` `hasEducationalAlignment` → the skill-area SFI it teaches (a
"Production d'Écrits" session aligns to a `Production d'écrits` SFI). That alignment is
how a session knows its objective — do not copy the objective's text onto the session.
(A day `Lesson` itself teaches no standard; only its session `Activity`s align.)

## One parent per node

Unlike maths, a reading session `Activity` (and a `LearningComponent`) has **exactly
one containment parent** — its day `Lesson` via `hasPart` (a day `Lesson` in turn has
one parent, its `Semaine`). A routine attached to a session is a `usesRoutine` edge,
not containment — so it is not a second parent. There is no schedule axis here, so a
session with two `hasPart` parents is a genuine mistake.

## Bilingual convention

Titles and text carry both languages — Wolof (L1) first, French (L2) after a slash
("Tari-Taalif / Poésie-Récitation"); `raw.inLanguage` records the language. The
Wolof is load-bearing, not decoration — preserve it when you author or edit a session.

## Authoring conventions

- **Add a session:** create an `Activity` under its day `Lesson` (`hasPart`), give it a
  `position`, and align it to the skill-area SFI it teaches (`hasEducationalAlignment`).
- **Add a day:** create a `Lesson` under its `Semaine` (`hasPart`) at a `position`.
- **Numbering** is the node's `position` (week number, day number, session order within
  the day); membership is the edge, so repositioning never cascades.
- **Kinds are the graph's own words** — the week is a `LessonGrouping` (`groupName`
  `Semaine`), the day is a `Lesson`, the session is an `Activity`, the skill area is the
  SFI's `statementType`.

## Removing content

- **`delete_nodes` and `delete_edges` are bulk.** Both take an ARRAY of ids and
  remove one or many in ONE atomic draft edit (one dry-run + one confirm) — not one
  round-trip per item. All-or-nothing: a missing id, or an id listed twice, blocks
  the whole batch.
- **`delete_nodes` cascades along containment** (`hasPart`). Because reading has one
  parent per node (see above), the cascade is clean: deleting a day `Lesson` takes its
  session `Activity`s, deleting a `Semaine` takes its day `Lesson`s and their sessions
  — plus every edge incident to a removed node. The dry-run WARNS with the FULL set
  that will vanish; read it before confirming (no force flag).
- **To keep a subtree, detach first:** `delete_edges` the `hasPart` edge into the
  node, then `delete_nodes` it — the detached sessions survive.
- Both are DRAFT edits — nothing is live until `publish_draft`.

## Coverage expectations

There are no automatic coverage warnings on an edit, `diff_draft`, or publish —
`review_draft` checks all of them against the draft and reports any it finds:

- **No empty week or day** — every `Semaine` has day `Lesson`s, and every day `Lesson`
  has at least one session `Activity`.
- **One parent per session** — a session `Activity` (or a `LearningComponent`) has
  exactly one parent.
- **Every session aligned** — each session `Activity` has a `hasEducationalAlignment`
  edge to the skill-area SFI it teaches; an unaligned session is unmoored from the
  curriculum.

## Generating documents from the graph

The deliverable is the **bilingual weekly teacher guide** (*guide de l'enseignant·e /
gindeekukaayu jàngalekat bi*). Its identity is a **`TeachingLearningMaterial`** (TLM)
named "Guide de l'enseignant" that `covers` the **Planification** Course — generation
targets the document (the TLM), and the curriculum it renders is the covered Course's
week subtree. The graph carries most of what generation needs — read it rather than
inventing.

**Where formatting and pedagogy live.** Two kinds of authored spec ride the graph, on
two different axes:

- a session `Activity` `usesRoutine` a **routine** — the ordered steps, timing, and
  scripted teacher/pupil moves that fix that session type's phase structure (a routine
  attaches to an `Activity`, which is the canonical LC edge);
- the **TLM** `hasPart` **`Formatter`s** (each `hasPart` its `FormatterSpec`s) —
  reusable specs that fix the document's look and its shared conventions (bilingual
  page layout and cue codes, modelling tables, analysis grids, illustration
  placeholders, and so on). Formatting is a property of the **document**, so it hangs
  off the TLM, **never** off the Course via `usesRoutine`.

**These are authored data, not a fixed set.** A curator can add, swap, or remove
routines (on sessions) and formatters (on the TLM, via `use_formatter`). So **discover
them from the graph** rather than assuming which exist: follow whatever routine a
session carries, and apply whatever formatters the document's TLM carries.

**The guide is self-contained.** The reading texts (*Jukki*), their illustrations, the
vocabulary, the questions, the exercises and the expected answers all live inside it.
Never reference a separate pupil book or cite a page ("turn to page …").

### Reading a week from the graph

Walk the week `Semaine` → its day `Lesson`s (`Jour 1`…`Jour 5`, in `position` order) →
each day's session `Activity`s in `position` order. For each session,
`get_standards(session)` gives the skill-area SFI it teaches (the *osTexte*) and its
components, and the session's `usesRoutine` routine gives the phases to follow.
**Produce exactly the sessions the graph returns, in order**, with each session's
language and duration — none added, dropped, or reordered. Follow the routine's steps
as the session's phase spine (do not thin them out), and apply the document's formatters
(from the TLM) for layout, cues, and shared conventions. A `remediation` session teaches
no standard (`get_standards` is empty).

When a session already carries **authored content** (`Material` under it via `hasPart`),
render it **faithfully** — do not paraphrase, merge, reorder, or "improve" an approved
phase. When it carries none, compose the session freely to the same grain, following its
routine.

Write **native-quality Wolof** throughout — preserve every diacritic (ñ, ŋ, à, é, ë,
ó), use full word forms, and never substitute a French calque where a Wolof term exists.

### Characters & reading texts

The programme's world is one connected family — **reuse it, don't invent a new lead**:
**Mari** and **Badu** (twins, ~8–9), **Omar Ndaw** (*Baay Omar*, the father), **Astou
Diop** (*Yaay Astu Jóob*, the mother), **Póol**, **Rëne** (an uncle), and the
*maîtresse*. Keep texts anchored in everyday Senegalese life (compound, school,
market, village, fields, well).

Compose the week's reading text(s) (*Jukki*) yourself and print them **in full** inside
the relevant session: genre-faithful to the week's target, CE1-decodable (short
sentences, common vocabulary), each with a title (*Boppu jukki*), a short target-word
lexicon, a *Màndargay jukki* grid for descriptive work, and text-dependent questions with
the expected answer given for the teacher.

### Missing official wording

Take OS / competency / palier wording **verbatim** from the tools. When they do not
supply a required official statement, insert a **visible placeholder**
(`[à compléter : libellé officiel du palier N]`) and continue — never fabricate an
official-sounding line.
