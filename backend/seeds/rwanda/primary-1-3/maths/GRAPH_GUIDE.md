  ⚠️  SEED, NOT THE SOURCE OF TRUTH.

  This file is what a namespace's guide was FIRST CREATED FROM. The guide the
  server actually serves lives in that namespace's config cell in Firestore, and
  experts edit it there through `edit_profile`. The two drift apart the moment
  anyone edits the live one — and they have: this copy still describes shapes the
  live curriculum no longer has.

  To read what is actually in force:   get_graph_guide  (or get_profile)
  To change it:                        edit_profile, then publish_draft

  Editing THIS file changes nothing that is running. It is used only to seed a
  brand-new namespace, and it is not shipped in the production image.

# Rwanda Maths (Primary 1–3) — graph guide

How the Rwanda maths knowledge graph is shaped. This is a **standards-only
reference framework** — the REB Competence-Based Curriculum (CBC) for primary
mathematics (an EIDU export). There is no teaching content to author or generate:
no `Lesson`, `Activity`, or `Material`, and no deliverables. You browse and align
against it; you do not author lessons into it.

## The hierarchy

A single `StandardsFramework` root, then a pure `hasChild` tree of
`StandardsFrameworkItem`s whose **kind is their level** (their `statementType`).
The CBC nests deeper than most, and each Unit fans out into a Key Unit Competence
plus three objective strands:

```
Grade (Primary 1 / Primary 2 / Primary 3)
  └─ Grade Key Competence          (the grade's overarching competence)
       └─ Topic Area               (a broad maths domain)
            └─ Sub-Topic Area      (a sub-domain within the topic area)
                 └─ Unit           (a teaching unit)
                      ├─ Key Unit Competence               (the unit's target competence)
                      ├─ Knowledge Objective               (knowledge & understanding)
                      ├─ Skills Objective                  (skills)
                      └─ Attitudes and Values Objective    (attitudes & values)
```

The three objective strands (Knowledge / Skills / Attitudes and Values) are the
finest standards leaves. A `LearningComponent` `supports` an objective (or a Key
Unit Competence) — the fine-grained skills EIDU attaches beneath the standards.

## Only two edge types

- `hasChild` — the containment tree above (Grade → … → objectives).
- `supports` — a `LearningComponent` to the SFI it elaborates.

There is **no** `hasPart`, no `hasEducationalAlignment`, and no ordinal field —
sequence is traversal order, not a `position`.

## Conventions

- **Kinds are the graph's own words** — an SFI's level is its `statementType`
  (`Grade`/`Grade Key Competence`/`Topic Area`/`Sub-Topic Area`/`Unit`/`Key Unit
  Competence`/`Knowledge Objective`/`Skills Objective`/`Attitudes and Values
  Objective`); the fine-grained skills are `LearningComponent`s by label.
- **No content authoring, no coverage.** This framework exists to be browsed and
  aligned against, not to hold generated materials — nothing to "complete", so no
  coverage expectations.
- **Deleting is bulk and cascades.** `delete_nodes` / `delete_edges` each take an
  ARRAY (one atomic draft edit, all-or-nothing). `delete_nodes` cascades along
  `hasChild`: removing an SFI takes its descendants and their incident
  `supports`/`hasChild` edges. The dry-run WARNS with the full set before you
  confirm (no force flag).
