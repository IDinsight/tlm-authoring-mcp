/*
 * Module: kg-store · internal
 *
 * Two-phase confirm framework for GRAPH mutations. A mutation is a pure
 * function over {nodes, edges}; the framework layers dry-run/confirm plumbing
 * on top so every new mutation gets:
 *   • preview → shared confirm envelope + per-mutation diff + warnings + a
 *     confirmation token; changes NO state.
 *   • confirm → token check (base version still current, nonce unused,
 *     mutation + args match the preview), lazy draft creation if needed,
 *     apply to the DRAFT slot only.
 *
 * STAKES: graph mutations STAGE a draft edit that is only visible to
 * generation after a SEPARATE publish step. This is intentionally different
 * from the document tools, which write live. The confirm envelope's `action`
 * field must carry that distinction verbatim — see envelope shape below.
 *
 * LAYERING: the framework works on the raw {nodes, edges} shape (see
 * SerializedGraph in curriculum/store-bridge.ts, mirrored here to keep
 * kg-store dependency-free). Curriculum-shaped mutations that need the
 * CurriculumModel serialize/deserialize on top of this — not inside it.
 *
 * The empty `validate` seam declared here is what #6 fills to make write-safety
 * rules block confirmation entirely (errors → no token, no confirm path).
