// collections, each with an id/type/namespace/slot/properties tuple — no
// CI-maths-specific fields bake into storage.
//
// State model (draft vs published): each namespace can hold at most two
// slots' worth of data ("a" and "b"). A single per-namespace pointer doc
// says which slot is currently published, and (optionally) which slot holds
// the in-progress draft — see StoredPointer. All external reads resolve to
// the published slot. Publish is a single-doc pointer flip, which is
// therefore atomic; concurrent readers either see the pre-publish snapshot
// or the post-publish one, never a mix.

  //
  // createDraft: open a draft as an EMPTY OVERLAY on top of published — O(1), no
  //   graph copy (canonical + changeset model; see the design note). Sets
  //   draftSlot in the pointer and carries the published profile CONFIG + meta
  //   cell so the draft opens from the published profile. A draft read merges
