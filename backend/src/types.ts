 * One recorded FILE.
 *
 * The entry's identity is its `relPath`, because the file is the thing that
 * exists in the bucket — and one curriculum node is covered by SEVERAL files.
 * A CI-maths lesson has four: the pupil's tool in French and in Wolof, and the
 * teacher's guide in each. Keying by the covered node could hold one of them,
 * so recording the second silently replaced the first.
 *
 * The other three fields say how a file is FILED rather than identified:
 *   nodeId     — the curriculum node it covers ("everything for lesson 1")
 *   documentId — the document it was produced from (the pupil's tool, the
 *                teacher's guide): what distinguishes two files covering the
 *                same lesson
 *   variant    — which rendering of that document ("FR", "WO"), the same
 *                variants a formatter's `render.language` already declares
 *
 * documentId and variant are optional: entries migrated from the node-keyed
 * schema have neither, and they still read, page and reconcile correctly.

// SubjectAdapter — the single per-(grade, subject) object the rest of the
// server dispatches to. It is no longer hand-written per subject: a subject is a
// declarative `SubjectProfile` (adapters/profile.ts), and one generic factory
// (adapters/build.ts::buildAdapterFromProfile) synthesizes this object from it.
// The runtime shape below is what consumers see; its fields are DERIVED from the
// profile's data (see docs/design-notes/authorable-catalog.md, phase 2).
// Deliberately BEHAVIOR ONLY: no schema, no LC property/edge/cardinality
// declarations, no integrity rules. Write-safety rules live in the write tools.
//
// Common core:
//   - raw-schema knowledge (detect + parse) — the only place that touches raw
//     graph JSON. `parse` is `parseGraph` bound to the profile's descriptor;
//     the storage round-trip is handled generically by curriculum/store-bridge.ts;
//   - `model()` — the parsed CurriculumModel (memoized). The cooked per-unit
//     projection (slice/listUnits/…) and buildGenerationContext were removed once
//     generation moved to the generic graph readers (walk_graph / get_standards);
//
// Every field is now common: the last subject-CONDITIONAL surface (the
// `capabilities` flags and the example-domain helpers they gated) was retired
// with the CI-maths domain tools, so an adapter is the same shape for every
// subject and differs only in the DATA its profile supplies. (Deliverables went
// earlier — a document's identity is the graph node it covers; see
// docs/design-notes/graph-linked-documents.md.)

  // read a created node's identity skeleton (labels, normalized type, ordinal
  // path) from the graph itself. See kg-recipes/lc.ts.

  // Coverage/completeness is no longer an adapter hook: the coded rules were
  // retired (phase 2c) in favour of the subject's coverage EXPECTATIONS authored
  // as prose in the graph guide, reviewed on demand by `review_draft`.
