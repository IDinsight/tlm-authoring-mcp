/*
 * Test fixtures — the curriculum graphs the suite parses/seeds.
 *
 * The KG lives only in the store now (docs/design-notes/firestore-only-store.md),
 * so these graphs are plain committed TEST DATA under test/fixtures/, not a
 * runtime source of truth. This module gives tests a `test/fixtures/`-rooted
 * `subjectDir` + `KG_FIXTURE` (drop-in for the old context.subjectDir + CONFIG.kgFile),
 * and — as an import-time side effect — registers the fixture catalog as the
 * installed contexts so `listAvailableContexts()` (and `activateContext`) resolve
 * them without a live store. Reached through the __tests__/index.js barrel; the
 * store/session scaffolding built on top lives in harness.ts.
