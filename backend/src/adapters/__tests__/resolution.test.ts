/*
 * Resolution-mapping test
 *
 * The task requires the (workspace, grade, subject) → adapter registry to permit
 * many-to-one — two different keys pointing at one adapter builder — even if that
 * isn't the case for any subject shipped today.
 *
 * The check uses `__registerProfileForTest` to attach the SAME profile under
 * two synthetic keys, then asserts both resolve to adapters whose builder
 * output shares the same adapter id and capabilities. We deliberately do NOT
 * register these keys as part of listAvailableContexts (there are no source
 * folders for them) — the resolution mapping is source-independent by design.
