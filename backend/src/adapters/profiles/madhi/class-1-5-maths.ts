/*
 * Subject profile: Madhi maths, Class 1–5 (data, not behavior).
 *
 * A primary-maths standards framework in the Indian NEP/NCF idiom (an EIDU/LC
 * export). Standards-only (no Lesson/Activity/Material, nothing to generate); it
 * exists to be browsed and aligned against. Its hierarchy lives entirely in
 * `statementType` (Curricular Goal/Competency/Content) — where the generic reader
 * takes an SFI's kind from — so nothing extra is declared. No ordinal field →
 * `numberFrom` omitted; sequence comes from traversal order.
