/*
 * Subject profile: Nigeria maths, Primary 1–3 (data, not behavior).
 *
 * The NERDC "9-Year Basic Education Mathematics Curriculum" — an EIDU/LC export.
 * A standards-only graph (no Lesson/Activity/Material, nothing to generate); it
 * exists to be browsed. This LC dialect carries no `metadata.role` sidecar and a
 * single StandardsFrameworkItem label, so levels are distinguished by
 * `statementType` (Grade/Theme/Sub-Theme/Topic/Performance Objective/Content).
 * There is no ordinal field → `numberFrom` omitted; sequence comes from
 * traversal order. No deliverables or coverage — a reference framework has
 * nothing to complete.
