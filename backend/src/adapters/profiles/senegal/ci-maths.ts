/*
 * Subject profile: CI maths (data, not behavior).
 *
 * The converged `{ nodes, relationships }` LC envelope. Two axes read through
 * edges — schedule (week→OS) and content (chapter→lesson→OS). A `chapter` is a
 * content LessonGrouping; a `lesson` is a content Lesson aligned to its spine
 * `expectation` (the objectif spécifique). The bilan is canonical data
 * (educationalUse "Assessment" → isAssessment in parseGraph); the coded coverage
 * rules were retired in phase 2c, so expectations live in the guide's prose. See
 * docs/design-notes/graph-native-authoring.md.
