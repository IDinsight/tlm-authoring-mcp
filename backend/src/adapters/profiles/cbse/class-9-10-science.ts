/*
 * Subject profile: CBSE science, Class 9–10 (data, not behavior).
 *
 * The "Learning Framework — Science" published by the Central Board of Secondary
 * Education (CBSE) with Azim Premji University — an EIDU/LC export. Like Nigeria
 * maths this is a standards-only graph (no Lesson/Activity/Material, nothing to
 * generate); it exists to be browsed and aligned against. Its whole hierarchy
 * lives in `statementType` (Class/Content Domain/Chapter/NCERT Learning Outcome/
 * Content Domain Specific Learning Outcome/Indicator) — exactly where the generic
 * reader takes an SFI's kind from — so nothing extra is declared. There is no
 * ordinal field → `numberFrom` omitted; sequence comes from traversal order. No
 * deliverables or coverage — a reference framework has nothing to complete.
