/*
 * Subject profile: Ghana maths, Basic 4–6 (data, not behavior).
 *
 * The Ghana NaCCA "Basic School Curriculum — Mathematics" (an EIDU/LC export).
 * A standards-only graph (no Lesson/Activity/Material, nothing to generate); it
 * exists to be browsed and aligned against. Its hierarchy lives entirely in
 * `statementType` (Grade/Strand/Sub-Strand/Content Standard/Indicator) — the same
 * NaCCA shape as Ghana English, one grade band up. No ordinal field →
 * `numberFrom` omitted; sequence comes from traversal order.
