/*
 * Subject profile: Ghana English, Basic 1–3 (data, not behavior).
 *
 * The Ghana NaCCA "Basic School Curriculum — English Language" (an EIDU/LC
 * export). Like the other EIDU imports this is a standards-only graph (no
 * Lesson/Activity/Material, nothing to generate); it exists to be browsed and
 * aligned against. Its hierarchy lives entirely in `statementType`
 * (Grade/Strand/Sub-Strand/Content Standard/Indicator) — where the generic reader
 * takes an SFI's kind from — so nothing extra is declared. No ordinal field →
 * `numberFrom` omitted; sequence comes from traversal order.
