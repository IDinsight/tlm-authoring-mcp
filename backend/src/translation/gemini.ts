/*
 * Layer: services · module: translation
 *
 * A single pure function that asks Google Gemini to translate between French and
 * Wolof. It is deliberately subject-agnostic: the caller (the server tool group)
 * decides which glossary terms are relevant and passes them in as data, so this
 * module depends only on config — never on the curriculum/adapter layers.
 *
 * We call the Gemini REST endpoint with Node's built-in fetch (no SDK, no new
 * dependency) and ask for a JSON response so the model reports which direction
 * it detected alongside the translation.
