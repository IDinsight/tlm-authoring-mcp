/*
 * Module: server · tool group: CI-maths-specific
 *
 * Tools that only make sense for the CI maths storybook model (example-domain
 * rotation — keeping each chapter's object families fresh). MCP tools register
 * once at startup, before a context is chosen, so these are always registered
 * but gated at call time on capabilities.exampleDomainRotation: for a subject
 * that doesn't enable it they return "not applicable" rather than misleading
 * data. Delegation goes through the active adapter's optional
 * suggestFreshDomain / domainUsage methods.
