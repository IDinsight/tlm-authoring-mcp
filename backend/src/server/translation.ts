/*
 * Module: server · tool group: translation
 *
 * `translate` — FR↔Wolof translation backed by Google Gemini (which reads Wolof
 * more reliably than our in-house models). It is grounded in the active
 * subject's MOHEBS glossary: we scan the passage for terms the curriculum
 * already fixes a Wolof wording for and hand those to Gemini as a term bank, so
 * translations stay consistent with existing materials. This is generative
 * translation — distinct from `get_terminology`, which only looks up terms that
 * already exist in the glossary.
 *
 * Guarded like the other curriculum reads: it needs an active grade/subject to
 * resolve the glossary. It never touches the KG store or Cloud Storage.
