/*
 * Module: server · tool group: curriculum (local sources)
 *
 * Read-only access to the active subject's curriculum graph and terminology.
 *
 * `get_standards` is a thin generic graph reader: it surfaces raw Learning-Commons
 * nodes (labels + properties) and their edges, and does NO projection — no
 * chapter/week/lesson vocabulary, no cooked slice. The caller (the LLM) reads the
 * nodes and assembles materials itself; keeping the logic out of the tool is the
 * point (see docs/design-notes/logic-in-the-graph.md). To find a subject's Course
 * content roots, use namespace_stats (its `roots`); to read a course's SUBTREE,
 * use walk_graph (server/graph.ts) — the generic traversal that replaced get_course.
