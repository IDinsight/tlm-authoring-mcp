/*
 * Module: server · tool group: node field edits (edit_node)
 *
 * edit_node is the single field-edit verb: change a node's content, position,
 * and/or display title in one atomic draft edit. It consolidated the separate
 * set_content + reposition tools and added title editing (which had no verb after
 * upsert_property was removed). Node CREATION is add_nodes (server/authoring.ts);
 * re-parenting is move_node.
 *
 * It shares the graph-mutation envelope: a dry-run returns a diff + warnings +
 * confirmationToken (no state change); the confirm re-checks the token and
 * applies to the DRAFT only.

        "Edit a node IN PLACE in ONE atomic draft edit — the single field-edit verb (it replaced set_content + reposition and added title editing). Only `nodeId` is required. Every editable field is OPTIONAL and independent: supply just the ones you want to change (a single field is fine) — any unsupplied field is left untouched, never cleared. Provide AT LEAST ONE of: `content` (load-bearing text, canonical LC Material.content), `position` (ordinal among siblings — membership is the containment edge, so this NEVER cascades; only labels that carry a position in LC — LessonGrouping/Lesson/Activity/routine steps — have one), `title` (display name — normalized to the node's title/text field per its label), `title_en` (English mirror), `summary` (a routine/formatter's cross-cutting blurb → raw.metadata.summary, the field list_catalog / get_catalog_entry / walk_graph surface), `properties` (a freeform object amending ANY OTHER canonical LC prop → written under raw.<key>, nested-merge — e.g. {\"metadata.assemblyGuide\":\"…\"}; the same bag add_nodes takes at create time, so a raw prop can be amended later without a dedicated argument). `properties` REFUSES protected paths — LC identity (normalizedType / normalizedStatementType / metadata.role / identifier) and the mirrored fields that have their own argument (use `position` for the ordinal, `title` for the display name/description, `content` for the Material payload). A nonexistent `nodeId` is BLOCKED; to remove content, delete the node instead. Edit in place — do NOT delete + re-add (that cascades the subtree, drops every incident edge, and mints a new id). REQUIRES CONFIRMATION: the dry-run returns a diff + confirmationToken; confirm with confirm:true + the token. When the dry-run reports `payloadStored:true` (a large edit held server-side), confirm with ONLY confirm:true + the token — do NOT re-send `content`; otherwise re-send the same fields. DRAFT edit — publish_draft to make it live. " +
        "`catalog` (optional) edits a CATALOG LIBRARY entry instead of the active subject graph — use it to fix a stale master that use_routine / use_formatter would otherwise keep re-cloning. Pass 'workspace' (your own library), 'shared' (the cross-tenant one), or a workspace id; ids come from list_catalog / get_catalog_entry. Crossing into another workspace's or the shared library needs super_admin. TWO DIFFERENCES from a subject edit: confirming PUBLISHES the library live in one step (catalogs are not enterable contexts, so there is no publish_draft or diff_draft for them), and you must RE-SEND `catalog` on the confirm alongside the token. Note the copies already made from an entry are independent — fixing the master does not reach them; edit those in the subject graph separately.",
