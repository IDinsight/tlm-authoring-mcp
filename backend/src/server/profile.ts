/*
 * Module: server · tool group: subject-profile config
 * (get_profile / edit_profile / get_graph_guide)
 *
 * The subject PROFILE is a two-field record (phase 2c): a machine `core` (the
 * declarative config that drives parsing) plus an
 * optional authored `guide` — markdown the AUTHORING/GENERATING LLM reads to
 * interpret and modify the graph. Reads consume only the core; the guide never
 * sits on the read hot path. The record lives in the store's config cell beside
 * the graph, rides the shared draft/publish loop, and is edited here through the
 * same two-phase envelope as a graph edit. The Zod guard that used to run only at
 * process load now runs at AUTHORING time: edit_profile injects it into the
 * store's config-flow, so a malformed core is refused at dry-run instead of
 * mis-parsing a whole workspace at runtime.
 *
 * `get_graph_guide` is the LLM-facing read — just the markdown, like
 * get_terminology surfaces per-subject text. See docs/design-notes/authorable-catalog.md.

/*
 * An omitted `guide` means KEEP THE LIVE ONE — it never means "delete it".
 *
 * The config cell is a { core, guide } record written WHOLE: edit_profile
 * replaces, it does not patch. So a caller who sends only `core` — to change one
 * parsing value — used to have the ~24 KB of authored prose beside it silently
 * dropped, on a path the tool advertised as "a bare core is accepted for
 * back-compat". That is the same full-replace hazard the seed scripts had, and
 * it is worse here: to change one machine field through the tool, every caller
 * had to round-trip the whole guide back VERBATIM through a language model,
 * which is lossy by construction and near-undetectable when it goes wrong.
 *
 * The merge is done HERE, in the app layer, rather than inside the two-phase
 * flow: the flow hashes the record for its confirmation token, so it has to be
 * handed the record that will actually be written. Merging first means the
 * dry-run diff, the token hash and the applied bytes all describe the same
 * thing.
 *
 * It re-merges identically on the confirm leg: the base is CAS-checked against
 * the dry-run, so the guide it reads is the one it read then, and the re-sent
 * record hashes to the same `pv`. If someone else edited the guide in between,
 * the hashes disagree and the confirm is refused — which is correct, because the
 * record previewed is no longer the record that would be written.
 *
 * Deleting a guide on purpose is still possible: pass `guide: ""`. Absent means
 * "leave it alone"; empty means "make it empty".
