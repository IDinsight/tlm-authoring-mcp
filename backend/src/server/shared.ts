//     envelope with `isError` set, instead of the SDK's bare `error.message`.
// The typed code (STORE_UNAVAILABLE vs INTERNAL_ERROR vs …) is what lets a
// caller tell a datastore outage apart from a logic bug — the distinction that
// was impossible when every failure read "Tool execution failed". The real
// message is always included; a stack is added only in debug mode (TLM_DEBUG=1).
// (Argument-validation failures are caught by the SDK BEFORE the handler runs,
// so they surface as the SDK's own "Input validation error: …" — already
// distinct from the handler-side codes below.)
// Every source- or bucket-dependent tool is registered through this.

// Human confirmation for outward-facing / state-changing tools (file uploads,
// history writes, and the graph-mutation framework). Returns a ToolResult (→
// caller does NO side effect) unless the user has approved, in which case it
// returns null (→ proceed). "Best available" gate across clients:
//   • Client supports MCP elicitation → ask the USER directly via a dialog the
//     agent cannot forge.
//   • Otherwise → fall back to the agent-mediated two-step: no side effect until
//     the tool is re-called with confirm:true (the agent is told to ask first).
//
// MEASURED 2026-08-23: the client our experts use (Anthropic/ClaudeAI 1.0.0)
// reports `supportsElicitation: false` — visible on any `ping`. So the dialog
// branch has NEVER run in production, and every confirmed upload, history write
// and graph mutation to date was approved by the agent choosing to send
// confirm:true after asking in chat. That is still a real checkpoint (the agent
// is instructed to ask, and a human does answer), but it rests on the agent's
// cooperation, not on a dialog it cannot fake. Do not describe the fallback as
// equivalent, and weigh that honestly before relying on it for the destructive
// verbs (delete_nodes, publish_draft). See docs/design-notes/self-serve-authoring.md,
// risk 2.
