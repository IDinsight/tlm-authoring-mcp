/*
 * Module: server · tool group: draft lifecycle
 *
 * The curator loop, exposed as MCP tools:
 *
 *   diff_draft       — read-only. Whole-draft diff vs published. Curator +
 *                      approver only; unknown/no-role blocked.
 *   publish_draft    — approver only. Two-phase (dry-run whole-draft diff +
 *                      draft-level token → confirm promotes atomically).
 *   discard_draft    — curator or approver. Two-phase.
 *
 * All three use the active grade/subject via getActiveAdapter() (same
 * convention as namespace_stats, walk_graph, etc.) — no explicit namespace
 * arg. authorize() runs inside each underlying function, so denials never
 * leak the diff and never issue tokens. (Curriculum EDITS are the generic
 * graph verbs — add_node / move_node / edit_node — registered
 * from the recipes tool group.)

// motivated this), which overflows the token cap and hides the confirmationToken
// from the caller. "summary" (the new default) drops the diff for a compact
// `counts` object; "full" keeps it. Same split, and the same countsOf contract,
// as the batch tools (add_nodes / create_edges) — so the mutation family is
// consistent. Only the dry-run (preview) carries a diff to strip; the commit
// results are already diff-free, so they pass through untouched in both modes.
//
// The staged profileDiff is dropped in summary like the graph diff (both are
// large detail); the "(includes a subject-profile change)" note already rides
// the action/message, so summary still signals that a profile edit is pending.
