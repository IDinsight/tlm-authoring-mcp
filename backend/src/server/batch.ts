/*
 * Module: server · batched-mutation response shaping + idempotency orchestration
 *
 * Shared by add_nodes / create_edges. Two concerns:
 *   • returnMode — an 84-item batch's full diff is ~200 KB, which forces callers
 *     to save-and-grep just to read the token + minted ids. "summary" (the
 *     default) replaces `diff` with a small `counts` object; "full" keeps the
 *     diff alongside it.
 *   • idempotency — a retried confirm carrying the same `idempotencyKey` replays
 *     the first apply's summary instead of erroring with REPLAY (see idempotency.ts).
 *
 * Storage/audit are untouched — this is purely response-shape + a retry cache.
