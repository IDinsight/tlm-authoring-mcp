/*
 * Module: curriculum · parse-time prunes (registry)
 *
 * A `postParse` hook (see parse-graph.ts GraphParseDescriptor) trims the flat
 * unit list before the model is built. It used to be a hand-written closure on a
 * subject's adapter; now a subject NAMES a generic strategy from this registry
 * in its profile (adapters/profile.ts PruneSpec), keeping the pruning MECHANISM
 * as shared code while the SELECTION is data (docs/design-notes/authorable-catalog.md,
 * decision D7 — a named reachability option, deliberately not a full authorable
 * pruning language for one subject).
 *
 * There is one strategy today, `content-reachable-from-roots`, which is the CE1
 * reading Scope-B/C prune generalised to take its root kinds as a parameter. Its
 * intermediate kinds are the canonical Learning-Commons kinds a node reports as its
 * own identity — a day is a `Lesson`, a session an `Activity` (canonicalised reading
 * shape), spine standards `Standard`, components `LearningComponent`, content
 * `Activity`/`Material`. No reading vocabulary leaks in. A second strategy is a small
 * generic addition here, never a per-subject file.

// stays lean. `rootKinds` selects the roots — e.g. `["Course"]` scopes a subject
