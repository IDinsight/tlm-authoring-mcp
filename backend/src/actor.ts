 * the verified auth layer (Supabase JWT → `req.auth.extra`), and read by tool
 * handlers via `currentActor()`. Tool arguments, request bodies, and custom
 * headers are never trusted for identity — the whole surface for setting the
 * actor is `resolveActor(auth)` below, so a later change (e.g. flipping the
 * unknown-actor policy or adding roles) happens in one place.

 * This is step 1 of a larger roadmap (curator/approver roles, audit log,
 * draft/published split). Everything downstream will build on this — do not
 * add spoofable inputs here.
