# Deploying to Cloud Run

The server runs as a remote MCP server (Streamable HTTP, `dist/http.js`) on Cloud Run in the
`senegal-ci-maths` GCP project. Supabase Auth is the OAuth authorization server; this service
only validates its JWTs. Users connect via Claude custom connectors pointing at `PUBLIC_URL/mcp`.

## How deploys run

**The normal deploy is a GitHub Actions job**, not a laptop command — the "Deploy to
Cloud Run" workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) builds from the checked-out repo and
authenticates with no JSON key. Because a deploy rolls the single Cloud Run instance and
drops in-memory MCP sessions, it is **not** triggered on every push — *you* choose when:

- the **Run workflow** button (Actions tab → "Deploy to Cloud Run"), from any branch; or
- push a version tag: `git tag v1.4.0 && git push origin v1.4.0`.

Setup for that job is in [CD: deploy from GitHub Actions](#cd-deploy-from-github-actions-workload-identity-federation)
below. The [manual `gcloud run deploy`](#manual-deploy-fallback--first-bootstrap) is the
fallback (and the first-ever deploy, before the service exists). The GCP/Supabase one-time
setup and smoke checks in between apply to both paths.

## One-time setup

```bash
gcloud config set project senegal-ci-maths

# Dedicated least-privilege runtime service account
gcloud iam service-accounts create tlm-server --display-name "MOHEBS TLM MCP server"

# Bucket access + signed-URL signing (no JSON keys anywhere)
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://senegal-ci-maths.firebasestorage.app \
  --member "serviceAccount:tlm-server@senegal-ci-maths.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role roles/storage.objectAdmin
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
  tlm-server@senegal-ci-maths.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --member "serviceAccount:tlm-server@senegal-ci-maths.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator
```

## Manual deploy (fallback / first bootstrap)

Prefer the [GitHub Actions deploy](#cd-deploy-from-github-actions-workload-identity-federation);
reach for this manual command only as a fallback, or for the **first-ever** deploy before the
service exists. It uploads your working tree from your laptop each time. The server package
(with its `Dockerfile`) lives under `backend/`, so the build source is that directory rather
than the repo root.

```bash
gcloud run deploy senegal-mohebs-tlm \
  --source backend \
  --project senegal-ci-maths \
  --region europe-west1 \
  --service-account tlm-server@senegal-ci-maths.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --max-instances 1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars "FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=senegal-ci-maths.firebasestorage.app,SUPABASE_URL=https://<ref>.supabase.co,SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<public anon key>,PUBLIC_URL=https://<service-url>"
```

Notes:

- `--allow-unauthenticated` refers to the **GCP IAM layer** only — app-level auth is enforced
  by the server itself (Supabase JWTs; it refuses to start without `SUPABASE_URL` unless
  `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=1`, which must never be set in production).
- `--max-instances 1` is required for now: MCP session state is held in memory, so requests
  must land on one instance. Fine at this scale; revisit with sticky sessions if usage grows.
- **First deploy chicken-and-egg:** `PUBLIC_URL` must equal the service URL, which you only
  know after the first deploy. Deploy once, read the URL, then update the env var
  (`gcloud run services update senegal-mohebs-tlm --update-env-vars PUBLIC_URL=...`).
- No `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH` on Cloud Run — the runtime service account provides
  Application Default Credentials; signed URLs sign via the IAM credentials API
  (hence the TokenCreator role above).
- The KG lives in **Firestore, not the image**, so adding or updating a graph needs **no redeploy** —
  use `import:kg-store` (see [`docs/technical-reference/store.md`](docs/technical-reference/store.md)).
  A *new subject* still needs a redeploy, because its profile is code (registered under
  `backend/src/adapters/profiles/`). The per-subject `backend/seeds/` (terminology, prompt files) ship in the
  image, so changing those needs a redeploy too.

## Supabase dashboard configuration

The server hosts Supabase's delegated login/consent UI at `/oauth/consent` (hence
`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, the public browser key from Project Settings → API). Configure:

- **Authentication → OAuth Server**: enabled, **Dynamic OAuth Apps** on,
  **Authorization Path** = `/oauth/consent`.
- **Authentication → URL Configuration**: **Site URL** = `https://<service-url>`
  (the TLM service — it serves the consent page for both MCP servers), and **Redirect URLs**
  must list every origin that starts a sign-in — there are two:
  - `https://<service-url>/**` — the `/oauth/consent` page, i.e. signing in from **Claude**
    while adding the connector.
  - `https://senegal-ci-maths.web.app/**` and `https://senegal-ci-maths.firebaseapp.com/**` —
    signing in from the **explorer**. Add `http://localhost:5173/**` for local explorer dev.

  Both flows pass Supabase a `redirectTo`. An origin missing from this list is not an error:
  Supabase silently falls back to the **Site URL**, so the user lands on the service root with
  a valid token in the URL fragment and nothing to spend it on. `GET /` catches that case and
  forwards the token to the explorer (`backend/src/landing.ts`), but it is a net, not the fix —
  the allow-list is.
- **Authentication → Users**: invite designers by email (they set a password via the invite link).

## Claude connector

Point a Claude custom connector at `https://<service-url>/mcp`. The 401 challenge advertises
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, which points at the Supabase authorization server —
the client discovers the login flow from there, registers itself dynamically, and sends the
user to the consent page above.

## Smoke checks after deploy

```bash
curl -s https://<service-url>/health                                   # → ok  (NOT /healthz — see note)
curl -s https://<service-url>/ | grep -o '<title>.*</title>'           # → landing page, not "Cannot GET /"
curl -s https://<service-url>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource     # → AS pointer
curl -si -X POST https://<service-url>/mcp -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{}' \
  | head -3                                                            # → 401 + WWW-Authenticate
```

> **Note:** use `/health`, not `/healthz`, for external checks. Google's Front End
> reserves the literal path `/healthz` and returns its own 404 before the request
> reaches the container, so `/healthz` is only reachable by a container-internal
> probe. `/health` is the same handler on a non-reserved path.

## CD: deploy from GitHub Actions (Workload Identity Federation)

The manual `gcloud run deploy --source backend` above uploads your working tree
from your laptop every time. A GitHub Actions deploy job builds from the checked-out
repo instead — **no source upload from your machine** — and authenticates to GCP
with **no JSON key**, via Workload Identity Federation (WIF): Actions presents a
short-lived GitHub OIDC token, GCP trusts it (scoped to this repo only), and the
workflow impersonates a dedicated `github-deployer@` service account.

Because a deploy rolls the single Cloud Run instance and drops in-memory MCP
sessions, the workflow is **not** triggered on every push — it runs on manual
dispatch (a button) or a `v*` git tag, so *you* choose when to roll the instance.

### One-time WIF setup

Run once, under your own gcloud user creds (needs project IAM-admin rights):

```bash
./scripts/setup-wif.sh
```

It is idempotent (create-if-absent), scopes trust to `IDinsight/tlm-authoring-mcp`
only, and prints the two values the workflow needs:

- `workload_identity_provider` — `projects/<number>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github/providers/github-tlm`
- `service_account` — `github-deployer@senegal-ci-maths.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

The deployer SA is deliberately separate from the runtime `tlm-server@` SA: it
holds deploy-time roles (`run.admin`, `cloudbuild.builds.editor`,
`artifactregistry.writer`, `storage.admin`) plus `iam.serviceAccountUser` on the
runtime SA (so it can deploy a service that *runs as* `tlm-server@`), while the
runtime SA stays minimal.

### GitHub environment

WIF is keyless, so there is **no secret to store**. The workflow references the two
values above directly (non-secret resource names). Env vars for the service
(`PUBLIC_URL`, `SUPABASE_*`, …) are already set on the Cloud Run service — a source
deploy preserves them unless `--set-env-vars` overrides, so the workflow omits them.
